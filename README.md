# Debugger: Go to Current Line

Do you find yourself deep into the source, debugging and just quickly want to return back to where the debugger is waiting?

If yes, this extension is for you. It adds a button to the debug toolbar

## Demo

If also uses the built-in VS Code command `workbench.action.debug.callStackTop` and your specific debugger should support it.
